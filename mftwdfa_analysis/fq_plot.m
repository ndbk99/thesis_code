% FUNCTION: fq_plot(folder_out,data_name,mftwdfa_settings)
%
% PURPOSE: plot log-log fluctuation function for given data and MFTWDFA settings
%
% INPUT:
% - folder_out: folder in which MFTWDFA data file is located
% - data_name: nametag of data series being examined
% - mftwdfa_settings: array of settings for the MFTWDFA run desired -- cell array in form {interp_scheme, data_res, q}
%
% OUTPUT: none, just plots Fq and saves figure in folder_out
